# DVD Rental Analysis

The objective of my report is to analyze the DVD rental database, specifically focusing on movie categories that contribute the most to rental frequency and revenue generation for the business. This analysis aims to enable a strategic allocation of inventory, focusing on categories that customers prefer the most. The ultimate objective is to optimize inventory management to meet customer demand effectively and enhance overall business performance and revenue.
